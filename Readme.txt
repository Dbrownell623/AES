Hello! This is My AES Encryption Project

Written by Daniel Brownell For Dr. Youssif Al-Nashif in CIS4362

**g++ AND make ARE BOTH NEEDED TO RUN THIS PROJECT

TO RUN THE FILES.
Step 1: Run a "make all" command in the terminal line
Step 2: use "./driver1" For all the keys
Step 3: use "./driver2" For AES ECB Encryption
Step 4: use "./driver3" For AES ECB Decryption of the ECB Encryption
